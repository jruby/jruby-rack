== 0.9.4

- Upgrade to Rack 0.9.1
- EXPERIMENTAL: Detect Rails 2.3 rack machinery and dispatch to it
  rather than the legacy CGI shim.
- EXPERIMENTAL: Beginnings of a JMS API (more details to come)
- REMOVAL: All the goldspike compatibility bits have been removed. You
  should upgrade your application to use a web.xml similar to what
  comes with Warbler.
- RackApplication-related core Java classes have been insulated from
  the servlet API, so that (parts of) JRuby-Rack can be used outside
  of a servlet container. If your application or library is coupled to
  these classes, you'll likely be broken with this release. See Nick
  for details.
- Fix TLD to be more compatible (Fred McHale).

== 0.9.3

- Merb updates for 1.0 compatibility
- Patch race condition in runtime pooling that allowed more than max
  number of runtimes
- Fix bug with backref interpretation and windows paths
- JRUBY-2908: Add fallback for when servletContext.getRealPath doesn't
  work (Joern Hartmann)
- Add extra prevention to ensure that IO descriptor keys do not leak in
  the runtime's cache of descriptors (see also JRUBY-3185)
- Switched to dual rake/maven build process
- Switched main code repository to github (for now)

== 0.9.2

- Upgrade to Rack 0.4.0
- Only chdir at startup when the /WEB-INF directory exists (fix for jetty-rails)
- Fix typos in rails tag tld
- Add getRuntime to RackApplication for use by non-web embedded applications
- Use a shared application factory for Rails if max runtimes == 1 (to support multi-threaded Rails)
- Change from jruby.initial.runtimes to jruby.min.runtimes to be consistent w/ Warbler

== 0.9.1

- Change each runtime's notion of current directory to /WEB-INF, so you can do
  loads and requires relative to WEB-INF
- JRUBY-2507: Update Rails boot override to not pre-load action_controller
- Don't assume or set cache_template_loading to true, rely on Rails to do it for us
- Set ENV['HTTPS'] = 'on' for Rails depending on servlet request scheme (Lenny Marks)
- Fix request URI -- must include query string
- Updated to be built and tested against JRuby 1.1.3
- Ensure that gem environment is set up for plain rack apps too
- JRUBY-2594: Fix URI-escaping issue (e.g., when spaces are in the path)
- Make use of 'Rails.public_path' in Rails 2.1
- JRUBY-2620: Fix issue with non-string headers
- Support integer and date headers directly
- Examples: Rails updated to 2.1, Camping and Sinatra examples added/working
