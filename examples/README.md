## JRuby-Rack Examples

This directory includes samples using JRuby-Rack to build Rack web applications for deployment
into Java app servers.

- All use [Warbler](https://github.com/jruby/warbler) to do so for easy of packaging.
- Require JRuby `9.4` and a compatible JVM (Java `8` -> `25`).

### Building/running

For deployment into a separate webserver:

1. ```bash
    bundle
    bundle exec warble war
    ```
2. Drop the war into a relevant Java app server running a compatible JVM version

As an executable jar within Jetty:

1. ```bash
    bundle
    bundle exec warble executable war
    ```
2. ```shell
    java -jar *.war
    ```

## Development

You can run the examples using local source for warbler or jruby-rack using env vars, e.g

```shell
export WARBLER_SRC=true JRUBY_RACK_SRC=true && bundle && bundle exec warble executable war && java -Dwarbler.debug=true -jar rails*.war
```

- Warbler can run directly from source
- jruby-rack needs to be built, since it does not define a gemspec
  - There are alternate ways to do this by replacing the jruby-rack jar within the warbled jar/war, however this is more
    complex and error-prone that using the gem and ensuring compatibility since warbler itself depends on the jruby-rack gem.
